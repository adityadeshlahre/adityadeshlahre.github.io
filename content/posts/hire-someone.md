### Idea

Hire Some One To Get Hired

- Feels wired right!

Past couple of months I have been thinking of getting hired or trying to get hired by some Remote companies. 

**_Remember the word "Remote" Here_** 

I wasn't geting any interview calls or any referals on tech twitter space which is a bit weird for my profile. Dispite the fact my [proof of work](https://p.aditya.ovh) is to strong (that is what i think other opinion doesn't matter to me) and i have been active on tech twitter/x space for past 2 Months. Still don't know what was happning to either is market or either twitter/x account out reach.

So, I started thinking of hiring some one to get hired. May be it feels dumb but it just an idea and I am not sure if it will work or not. But I can hire a simple guy who has access to all my resouces and reference and access to all my social access and insted of me doing all the work, he can do it for me am talking about cold outreach, dmeinng, etc. Right!

**What do you think of this idea ??**

And Please Don't talk about AI or Any sort of Tooling or Automations! No, I would allow that much access and to it or don't want something that I cannot control.

**How's the idea?**

**PS: I am still looking for Job**
