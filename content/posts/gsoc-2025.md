#### GSoC'2025

So this year **_2025_**, I applied to the organization **_The OpenELIS Global Foundation_** for the second time. Later on got disclosed with the project in November 2024 which was a good point where anyone can start contributing and beat me with their skills!

This time our organization is coming up with 7 projects this year. One of them is **Rewrite Test Management & Components JSP to ReactJS**. This time I was already familiar with the codebase and quite confident in my work.

So submitting a proposal was a must, hence after continuous contributions over 1.2 years, I submitted a proposal and there was less competition this time also because even though the project was disclosed too early.

Thank You!
