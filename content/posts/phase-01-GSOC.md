#### Phase 01 GSoC'2024 >>>>>>>>>>

So unlike other contributors, I was going through **Community Bonding Phase** _[date: 1 May > 27 May]_ where mostly contributors communicate more about their project to their project admin. I also did the same things, talked to my mentor **Mr Cliff Gita**. We have set up weekly meetings on Friday (eventually it didn't work out) so every week I present my work and updates to my mentors and similar things I do in THU's community meetings too.

Biggest support in the whole PHASE 01 on contributions was from **Mr Moses Mutesasira** in every take. He supported us in debugging and making things clear as well. Eventually he started giving extra time to community calls. Hence that was very helpful for faster development **:)**

Also whenever I have some specific doubts we connect on SLACK HUDDLES for faster development and debugging and fixes!

All i wanted to say till now i had a best experience in OPENELIS foundation and working here toooo.....
