### Best years of a dev

Let's suppose a developer starts his career at the age of 16 and the current year is 2025, then the best years of a dev are from the 7th to 12th year of their career which is 2032 to 2037.

Last few years I have been seeing that most senior developers and engineers are in their 7th to 12th year of their career and they are enjoying it.

A junior developer who started at 16, after grinding for 2-3 years will get a job and after that on the 7th year of their career they will be enjoying their career. Because now they have 2-3 years of experience and they have been working on real projects and they have been learning new things and growing their career.

I cannot name them here! But it's been a while I follow them and observe them unconditionally.

**Note:** It's just my general observation and I am not sure if it is true or not. But somehow it feels true to me.

Thank You!
