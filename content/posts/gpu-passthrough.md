### GPU Passthrough [qemu-kvm-vifo-pci]

#### [An unsuccessfull attempt]

> Example/Explanation Demo Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtkC_RnC7fE)!

This video is so so amazing once you watch it u will love it how seemlessly you can switch between linux to windows VM. Which is passed through you GPU output and getting displayed in monitor and parallel running vai single setup!

I tryed to do the same thing with my laptop which is [Acer-Aspire-07-5500U-1650gtxGPU]!

As tech nerd i tried did all research youtube,documentions,vifo,PCI outputs and everything.

I moved towards the configuring my laptop and found out that my HDMI output is connected to my **AMD-i-gpu** not the dedicated **1650-d-gtx-GPU**.

Suddenly i started hatting my laptop choice but later on i got to know about **Single-GPU** passthrough but this time.

I Found out that **Internal-GPUs** are not capable of it.

The video/point i got jelouse at is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU1T8V315Bc)!

#### Take Aways

- don't Know
- just learn stuff

Later on i left researching about thing and thought of building my own PC!
But this is another _pain in a butt_ so watched some videos and relealised this will cost money so left research here...

WOW so much time i wasted........! dammmm bro **NOT** on research **BUT** on watching videos.

and this is **_An unsuccessfull attempt_** of GPU passthrough.

Thank You
