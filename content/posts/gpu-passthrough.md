### GPU Passthrough [qemu-kvm-vifo-pci]

#### [An unsuccessful attempt]

> Example/Explanation Demo Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtkC_RnC7fE)!

This video is so amazing, once you watch it you will love how seamlessly you can switch between Linux to Windows VM. Which is passed through your GPU output and getting displayed on the monitor and running parallel via a single setup!

I tried to do the same thing with my laptop which is [Acer-Aspire-07-5500U-1650gtxGPU]!

As a tech nerd I did all the research: YouTube, documentation, vfio, PCI outputs and everything.

I moved towards the configuring my laptop and found out that my HDMI output is connected to my **AMD-i-gpu** not the dedicated **1650-d-gtx-GPU**.

Suddenly I started hating my laptop choice but later on I got to know about **Single-GPU** passthrough but this time.

I Found out that **Internal-GPUs** are not capable of it.

The video/point I got jealous at is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU1T8V315Bc)!

#### Take Aways

- don't Know
- just learn stuff

Later on I left researching about thing and thought of building my own PC!
But this is another _pain in the butt_ so watched some videos and realized this will cost money so left research here...

WOW so much time i wasted........! dammmm bro **NOT** on research **BUT** on watching videos.

and this is **_An unsuccessful attempt_** of GPU passthrough.

Thank You!
