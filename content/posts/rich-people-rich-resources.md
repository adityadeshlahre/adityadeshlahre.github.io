### Rich People Rich Resources

Just try to understand the statement not the key-words in the statement.

- `Take a look at my observation below`

## Observation

In corresponding to my 5 years of travel living with people around and observing them I landed on the observation that Rich People have some sort of resource which the people coming from different or humble (i hope you got it) background. Seem to have the comparative less access or knowledge about the things to pursue or how many way we can live the life right or consider it as <ins>**_Knowledge of Direction_**</ins>.

Definitely there is hard work involved on the both side but on the one side there is <ins>**_Direction_**</ins> + <ins>**_Resources_**</ins> that leads to the definite other side has to or needs to figure out it own the both things right.

Down the line the reliance of the first generation on it next generation is to always increase the resources increase the knowledge. Similarly on the other side there is need of fulfilling.

### TLDR

**_Kings kid will only become King_**

This theory remains the same for my surroundings till now, I guess!
