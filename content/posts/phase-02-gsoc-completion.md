#### Phase 02 GSoC'2024 completion >>>>>>>>>>

So from week one of GSoC [May 01 > August 25] I came so far slowly and gradually building Admin Pages and Components one by one. I have completed the whole project Admin Routes under the time limit which I presented to my mentors and they were happy with the work.

Initially the project seemed heavy but after understanding the codebase it's been going with the flow.

I have 2-3 weeks left so I eventually started working on different Test Management related pages and ended up making 2-3 more pages out of my project.

Eventually This is how my GSoC 2024 was Under Organization OpenELIS Global.

Thank You!
