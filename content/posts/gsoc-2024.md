#### GSoC'2024

So this year **_2024_**, I started contributing to an organization called **_The OpenELIS Global Foundation_** in January. Later on got to know this organization will be coming up in GSoC this year. After knowing this, I got super pumped and started contributing very aggressively.

This organization is coming up with 6 projects this year. One of them is **Rewrite Admin Pages & Components JSP to ReactJS**. I was already familiar with ReactJS and quite confident on it.

So submitting a proposal was a must, hence after aggressive contributing in the time frame of JAN-APRIL months, I submitted a proposal and there was less competition because this organization is coming for the first time in GSoC.

On **Date: 2024-05-01 at 18:00 UTC & 22:00 IST** there was mail in my inbox of getting selected in **_Google Summer of Code 2024_**.

And knowingly this is a 20th Year of GSoC happening

Thank You!
