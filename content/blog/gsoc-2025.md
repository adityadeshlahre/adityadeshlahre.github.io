#### GSoC'2025

So this year **_2025_**, I applied to organization **_The OpenELIS Global Foundation_** for the second time. Later on got discloed with the project on november 2024 which was good point where any one can start contributing and beet-me up with ther skills!

This time our organizations is coming up with 7 Projects this year. One of them is **Rewrite Test Management & Components JSP to ReactJS**. This time I was already familier with codebase and quite confident on my work.

So submitting proposal was must hence after continuous contribute in the time frame of 1.2 years. I submitted proposal and there were less compition this time also because this organization even the project was discloed to early.
