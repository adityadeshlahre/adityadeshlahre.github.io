#### Phase 02 GSoC'2024 completion >>>>>>>>>>

So from week one of GSoC [May 01 > August 25] I came to far slowlly and gradually building Admin Pages and Components one by one. I have completed the whole project Admin Routes Under time lint which i presented to my mentors and they were happy with the work.

Initially Project seem to heavy but after understanding the code-base it been going with the flow.

I have 2-3 weeks left so eventually started working on different Test Management Related pages and ended up make 2-3 more page out of my project.

Eventually This is how my GSoC 2024 was Under Organization OpenELIS Global.
